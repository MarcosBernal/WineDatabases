Sweet Cheeks 2017 Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley);Pinot Noir;Sweet Cheeks;United States of America;Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.;Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block;85;50.500;Oregon;Willamette Valley;Willamette Valley;Paul Gregutt;@paulgwineˇ
Trimbach 2017 Gewurztraminer (Alsace);GewÅrztraminer;Trimbach;France;This dry and restrained wine offers spice in profusion. Balanced with acidity and a firm texture, it's very much for food.;;90;20.000;Alsace;Alsace;;Paul Gregutt;@paulgwineˇ
Cepa Lebrel Reserva 2014  (Ribera del Duero);Tempranillo Blend;Pradorey;Spain;Desiccated blackberry, leather, charred wood and mint aromas carry the nose on this full-bodied, tannic, heavily oaked Tinto Fino. Flavors of clove and woodspice sit on top of blackberry fruit, then hickory and other forceful oak-based aromas rise up and dominate the finish.;Vendimia Seleccionada Finca Valdelayegua Single Vineyard Crianza;91;10.000;Northern Spain;Rioja;;Paul Gregutt;@paulgwineˇ
QuiÇvremont 2017 Vin de Maison Red (Virginia);Red Blend;QuiÇvremont;United States of America;Ripe aromas of dark berries mingle with ample notes of black pepper, toasted vanilla and dusty tobacco. The palate is oak-driven in nature, but notes of tart red currant shine through, offering a bit of levity.;Vin de Maison;89;19.000;Virginia;Virginia;;Paul Gregutt;@paulgwineˇ
